# Claude Project Instructions

Follow `AGENTS.md` at repository root as the primary instruction source.

Then:

1. Load relevant project rules from `/.agent/rules/`.
2. Discover and apply relevant skills from `/.agent/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
3. Write process artifacts to `workspace/` and archive to `workspace/archive/`.

Do not limit behavior to a single skill. Use the minimal set of matching skills for each task.
