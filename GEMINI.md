# Gemini Project Instructions

Follow `AGENTS.md` at repository root as the primary instruction source.

Then:

1. Load relevant project rules from `/.agent/rules/`.
2. Discover and apply relevant skills from `/.agent/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
3. Keep planning/execution artifacts in `workspace/` and archive to `workspace/archive/`.

Do not bind to one fixed skill path. Choose the minimal relevant skill set for the current request.
